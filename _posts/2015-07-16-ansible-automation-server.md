I'm fairly fond of Ansible as a light-weight configuration management tool,
but am always on the looking for additionally tooling that will make it a
bit easier to manage centrally...well, without paying for Ansible tower.  I
came across Ansijet and was pretty exciting.  It provides a REST API to 
Ansible itself, as well as storing results in MongoDB.  I still need to try
this out, but seems very promising.
