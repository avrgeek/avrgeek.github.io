A came across [an article in Medium](https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd) on the author's move to avoid Apple, Google, and Microsoft producs.  It's an interesting discussion on the power of these companies, and the compromises users submit to for the sake of convience.

I myself can completely understand, using Google Apps for the email of this domain.  Google has an easier time tracking me with the amount of services I use from them.  However, I think the cultivation of servicable options, as well as "...encouraging as many people as possible to find ways to take control for themselves."
