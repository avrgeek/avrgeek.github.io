This is the personal website of Steve Miller.  The domain name is from a phrase I said while drifting asleep: "We need 
to put a cookie on the R15 resistor"  Below you will find a brief summary of my experience.  If you wish to contact me please 
[fill out the form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SQcAaXNPm2zxWP145P-Gpu9xpY3NUn_bNT8SYqi8iTE/viewform?usp=send_form) and I will get back with you as soon as possible.

# Personal Projects

### Weather Station

Build a Raspberry-Pi driven weather station for home.  Other than being a really nifty project, also hoping to modify
a rain gauge to track estimated snowfall, and wake me up in time to plow our 500 ft. driveway if that becomes necessary.

### RFID Dog Feeder

Modify a dog feeder to dispense food based on a known schedule and RFID tags put on the collar of each dog.  Still in
the early planning stages, it will hopefully help keep our dogs well fed, but also provide lots of data for analysis!

### [Moo Machine](https://sites.google.com/a/stevenmiller.info/www/home/projects/moomachinehome)

An Altair 8800 style machine designed to implement the ["COW" programming language](http://web.archive.org/web/20130403133623/bigzaphod.org/cow/).  It's a really simplistic language, but is technically Turing complete.  The machine itself is powered by a Arduino Mega (more for the IO pins then the actual processor)  Unfortunately the 
original site is down, but thanks to the Internet Archive project, we can still view the original page.
